Project Description

Koboaccountant is a platform where SMEs and Accountants work together with the view to develop and ensure the SME venture stays profitable and productive.

SMEs are given the simplest and most intuitive environment to do their bookkeeping and also work with accountants. Accountants in turn also have automated tools to ensure that they deliver on their task optimally within the shortest time possible.

What is the Goal?
The goal of the project is to:

Ease accounting for businesses via a highly simplified and interactive platform.

Give SMEs access to Verified and trained accountants.

Make SME/Accountant partnership as easy as possible.

Automate accounting tools for accountants.


What Problem does this Project Solve?

SMEs owners are finding it hard to keep proper record of their daily transactions. 

SMEs typically cannot afford a good accountant so they try to do their accounting themselves. It’s basically, garbage in, garbage out. We are set to change that.

Businesses can totally outsource their accounting department and focus on other activities.

Businesses find it difficult to track performances properly because they don’t have access to KPIs.

Businesses will have access to professional advisory services from verified accountants.

Businesses have secured business data from any location.

What is the Mission & Vision?

	The mission of this project is to be the major platform for SMEs owners to manage their daily accounting activities. The vision is to make accounting easy and simple for all our onboarded clients.
